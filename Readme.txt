Please Read these instructions to run the codes or to know about locations of various outputs:
1) All the scripts are contained in the "src" directory.
2) I have used 5 different methods/models which will be explained in the report file.
3) All the training/validation results, for all the 5 models are in "validation_results" directory. It contains precision, recall, f1-score, accuracy etc in the form of csv files.
4) The results of test dataset are in the test_dataset_results directory,
5) Run the "zero-padding.ipynb" file first using the original dataset.
6) Run the "Reverse_padding.ipynb" file using the original dataset.
7) Use the dataset created in point-5 and run model1, model2,model3,model4.
8) To run model5, firstly run the "model-5-preprocess.ipynb", then run model5 code.
9) To evaluate all the models using test_samples, run the mlsp-evaluation.
